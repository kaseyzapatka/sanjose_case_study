## Prepare virtual environment
I created a virtual environment specifically for this exercise. You can recreate it running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. The python version used is `Python 3.13.5`. You need to first create a clean working environment. With `conda` you can do this by running this command in a terminal `conda create -n sanjose_case_study python=3.13.5` and then running `conda activate sanjose_case_study`.
